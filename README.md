## About NotesFlip
NotesFlip is a chrome extension that helps users take brief notes and also has the option to flip a coin (Notes + Coin Flip = NotesFlip).

## Motivation
My motivation for NotesFlip was to build a chrome extension to take brief notes instead of opening a notes app or google docs. Then, I decided to add a coin flip option to quickly make decisions.

## Challenges
The most challenging aspect of the project was understanding how to use chrome extensions and storing the notes with chrome.storage.sync. After looking up plenty of tutorials and reading on chrome storage, I played around with chrome.storage to finally get the notes to save. 

Overall, I'm glad that I learned to create a chrome extension and practiced my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

## Credits
I would not have been able to build this chrome extension without help from stackoverflow, freeCodeCamp, developer.chrome.com, and youtube tutorials.
